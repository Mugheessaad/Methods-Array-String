# Methods Array String

Welcome to the Methods Array String project! This repository is a collection of examples and demonstrations of various methods related to arrays and strings in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The Methods Array String project is showcasing different methods and techniques for manipulating arrays and strings. these methods are perform against these instruction given below:
  Array Manipulation:

a. Create an array named numbers containing the integers from 1 to 5.

b. Add the number 6 to the end of the array.

c. Remove the first element of the array.

d. Reverse the array.

e. Join the array elements into a string with a comma as the separator.

f. Use the map function to create a new array (squaredNumbers) containing the square of each number in the numbers array.

String Manipulation:

a. Create a string variable named message with the value "Hello, World!".

b. Extract and log the substring "Hello" from the message.

c. Convert the entire string to uppercase.

d. Check if the string contains the word "World" (case-insensitive).

e. Replace "World" with your name in the string.

f. Use the map function to create an array of characters from the string.

Math Operations:

a. Calculate the square root of 25.

b. Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

c. Round 3.14159 to the nearest integer.

Set Operations:

a. Create two sets, set1 and set2, each containing three unique elements.

b. Calculate the union of set1 and set2.

c. Check if set1 is a subset of set2.

d. Remove an element from set2.

e. Convert set1 to an array.

Map Operations:

a. Create an array named originalArray containing at least three numbers.

b. Use the map function to create a new array (doubledArray) containing each number doubled.
